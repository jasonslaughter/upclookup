# upclookup

This is a (very) basic UPC lookup I created as my first attempt at using Node.js. It is very much amateur code.

This is designed to use a USB barcode scanner attached to a Raspberry Pi. Scanning a barcode looks up the barcode number from a local database, as well as a few online UPC databases, and returns the first result. The results are shown on an LCD attached to the Raspberry Pi.

I made this as a toy for my kids to play with, so that they can scan barcodes around the house. It works, but it is not to be taken seriously.
